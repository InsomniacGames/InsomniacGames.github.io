<h2 id="confidence-in-leadership-and-decision-making">Confidence in Leadership and decision making</h2>
<p>An area I’m constantly trying to improve myself in, is to grow my confidence in the daily decisions I make. From when I first became a lead, to now, it’s never easy to make a decision that will affect how others work, especially when you are unsure if the result will be a positive or negative one. There always is a risk in making any decision, no matter how confident you are about it. Making a calculated decision can help increase your confidence level, but doesn’t eliminate the risk.</p>
<p>For me personally, I can tend to be overly cautious, which, instead of avoiding a risk can lead to a bad decision. I find it important to seek feedback from others, find out if they perceive the same outcome or even have a better idea worth considering. Even if they may not have the right answers, debating your decision can help strengthen your confidence in it. Getting buy in from someone who initially disagreed can also boost your confidence in your decision and help eliminate doubt.</p>
<p>Making tough decisions can be just that, tough. But being confident is reassuring to those you lead and others around you. It opens the path to leading with authority and how you are perceived. Your own confidence can help others put their faith in your decision-making ability and the goals you’re aiming to achieve for your team.</p>
