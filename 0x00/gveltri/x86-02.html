<p>First, I downloaded and used FASM to assemble files. FASM can be downloaded from flatassembler.net. It's pretty straightforward; extract the contents to a folder, add that folder (which contains FASM.exe) to the PATH environment variable, and add the INCLUDE subfolder to the INCLUDE path environment variable.</p>
<p>To tell FASM to compile a Windows executable, you must do:</p>
<pre><code>format PE console    ; This tells FASM that the output should be a portable executable console application.
entry start          ; This tells FASM where the program begins
include &#39;win32a.inc&#39; ; This is included with FASM and defines things needed to make a Windows executable.

; This declares the part of the file that is (readable) executable code
section &#39;.text&#39; code readable executable

; This is where the actual program begins.  Everything else is boilerplate.
start:

; This is the import section.
section &#39;.idata&#39; import data readable
import kernel,\
       ExitProcess,&#39;ExitProcess&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Note that there's no actual assembly code in the lines above. Everything above is either a directive known by FASM or defined by the win32a.inc include.</p>
