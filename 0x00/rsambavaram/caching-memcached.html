<p>In this day and age, we are seeing a data explosion. 90% of all data ever created has been created in the last 2 years and most of it is unstructured.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in-memory and generic (key-value pair) data storage has gained prominence compared to the more traditional relational databases of the past..</p>
<p>Memcached is the gold standard for caching in the IT world with almost every one using it. It retains this spot because of its simplicity.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcached.org/" class="uri">https://memcached.org/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Free and open source</li>
<li>Generic key-value store</li>
<li>High performance and distributed caching system</li>
<li>True cache sitting in front of slower databases</li>
<li>In-memory caching</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Memory is broken into fixed size allocators called slab_class.</li>
<li>Each slab_class allocates a fixed size.</li>
<li>Each slab_class has memory pages (default 1MB) assigned to it</li>
<li>Each page is finally divided into the chunks of the “slabs fixed size” eg., 0-1k, 1k-4k,….</li>
<li><img src="img_00.png" /></li>
<li>(image credit: <a href="http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/13506116892/memcached-internals-memory-allocation-eviction" class="uri">http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/13506116892/memcached-internals-memory-allocation-eviction</a>)</li>
<li>Values will always be stored to the chunk with the size closest to the slab chunk size</li>
<li>When a slab gets full and TTL (time-to-live) for a chunk is expired then LRU is used to evict. So eviction is within the scope of a slab and not at top level.
<ul>
<li>Eviction is done per slab, so one can start evicting while there is plenty of space in another slab.</li>
<li>Lazy-eviction: When the TTL is expired, it doesn’t reclaim memory immediately by triggering eviction. It is done either by another access to it or when memory is full in the slab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can configure Memcached to lazy allocate more pages to slabs instead of doing it at the start.</li>
<li>When memory is full for the slab and we are trying to allocate, it uses LRU within the slab to evict chunks whose TTL has expired.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clustering">Clustering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clustering is a misnomer in Memcached.</li>
<li>The server is &quot;dumb&quot;. Nodes in a cluster don’t communicate and are blind. Again simplicity even at this level enabled Memcached to be very fast and effective. The server relies on a client to use the hash algorithm to figure which node in the cluster to get the key-value from.</li>
<li><em>So there is no master node.</em></li>
<li>Clients all use the same hashing to hit the cache.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="client">Client</h2>
<ul>
<li>A client either wants to store a key-value pair or hit the cache with a key.</li>
<li>It uses a hashing algorithm to map a key to a node in a cluster and then checks if it can find the key-value in the Memcached server node.</li>
<li>The client specifies TTL for the key-value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limits">Limits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Key max is 250 bytes</li>
<li>Value max is 1MB</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everything is in-memory, so there is no persistence unlike other caches like Redis (Redis and its built-in persistence is the <a href="caching-redis.html">next topic in this series</a>. It relies on slower backend on a cache miss.</li>
<li>Cannot traverse all items (As this operation is slow and will block others)</li>
<li>When a new node is added to a cluster, one has to be mindful of losing existing cached data as there is no redistribution. (Because the client does the node access, this data is simply lost.)</li>
<li>Care should be taken to add one node at a time instead of adding a bunch together.</li>
<li>Don’t use simple mod like key to cluster node mapping. Almost everybody uses <a href="https://community.oracle.com/blogs/tomwhite/2007/11/27/consistent-hashing">consistent hashing</a> to minimize the data loss when a node is removed or added.</li>
