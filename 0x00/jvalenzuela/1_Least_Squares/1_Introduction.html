<h1 id="leastsquares">Least Squares</h1>

<p>My first topic is Least Squares. I went a little long so it&#8217;s split into two parts. This, the first one, attempts to answer &#8220;What is least squares and how does it work?&#8221; This is well trod ground so I wouldn&#8217;t expect even an advanced beginner to see anything <em>completely</em> new. For me the value was taking an idea from my &#8220;peripherally aware&#8221; set to my &#8220;can explain it to someone else&#8221; set. I encourage anyone interested to check out the links/books referenced for a comprehensive treatment.</p>

<h2 id="whatisit">What is it?</h2>

<p>One of the most effective tools in the optimization toolbox is also one of the simplest to use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">Least Squares Approximation</a> is a robust method that allows us to model systems using imperfect data and also generate approximating functions. Its applications are usually simple to spot, and the technique itself is easily coded.</p>

<p>The invention of least squares is generally credited to <a href="http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176345451">Gauss</a>, who famously used the method to determine the orbit of Ceres based on 40 days worth of historical data. Although Gauss gets the credit, the technique was known to his contemporaries and was in fact first published by Legendre.</p>

<p>Least squares is used to fit a model function to a data set, particularly when the data contains systematic errors which preclude a perfect fit. It is used in statistics to determine how closely a function corresponds to a line. There are variants to deal with varying reliabiliy of measurements, equality constraints, and minimizing the magnitude of the solution vector.</p>
