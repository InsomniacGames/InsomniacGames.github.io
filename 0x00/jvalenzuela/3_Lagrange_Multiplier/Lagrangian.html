<h1 id="thelagrangian">The Lagrangian</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s an equation that comes up a lot in optimization literature contexts. It&#8217;s part of the Karush–Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for first-order optimality for systems with multiple equality and inequality constraints. It&#8217;s used in dynamics. I&#8217;m talking about the Lagrangian. Just seeing where it pops up as been a useful touchstone in further reading for me. </p>

<p>The first exposure most of us had to the Lagrangian is through Lagrange Multipliers. Before that, a very brief refresher on the derivative and function extrema:</p>

<h2 id="functionextremaandthetangent">Function extrema and the tangent</h2>

<p>The extrema of a continuous, differentiable function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> along the interval <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span> occurs at one of the <em>critical points</em>, which are the endpoints and any point between <span class="math">\(a, b\)</span> where <span class="math">\(f'(x)=0\)</span>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="Extrema.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Here we see a graph of <span class="math">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + 0.41\)</span> between &#8211;3 and 3. The points at which the tangent of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is 0 have the blue lines. If we want to find either the maximum or minimum value of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> over 0 to 3, it suffices to test the value of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> at 0, those two points (<span class="math">\(x=\frac{2}{3}, 2\)</span>), and 3. This follows from the fact that the tangent before an extrema and the tangent after must have different signs, and since <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is continuous the point where the tangent switches signs (i.e., is 0) is an extrema.</p>

<p>Similarly you can distinguish whether an extrema is a minimum or maximum by testing the second derivative: if <span class="math">\(f''\)</span> is negative, then the tangent was itself decreasing and on its way to a maximum.</p>

<h2 id="lagrangemultipliers">Lagrange Multipliers</h2>

<p>The Lagrange multipler first shows up in multivariable calculus in this context: Given a function f(\textbf{x}) and a constraint g(\textbf{x}), how do we find the maximum value of f such that <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x}) = 0\)</span>? To find the answer we first to understand the <em>gradient</em> of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</p>

<p>The gradient helps generalize the concept of the tangent to arbitrary dimensions. Instead of a scalar that defines the tangent line at each point, the gradient is a vector that points in the direction of greatest change for a function. It&#8217;s normal to any level curve and so defines the tangent plane in which any tangent line for any level curve must lie. Given <span class="math">\(f(x,y,z)\)</span> the gradient ∇f is defined as <span class="math">\(\begin{bmatrix} \frac{f}{x} & \frac{f}{y} & \frac{f}{z} \end{bmatrix}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an image of the gradient at a point on a sphere:</p>

<figure>
<img src="Sphere.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The red arrow illustrates the ∇f at a point <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. A level surface, remember, is the set of points where a function takes the same value. A sphere, for example, is described by the level surface <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2+z^2=k\)</span>. In arbitrary dimensions the level surface is called a level curve.</p>

<p>Back to the original question: Given <span class="math">\(f(\textbf{x})\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})=0\)</span> it turns out, if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> intersect at all, <span class="math">\(f\)</span> takes a maximum at a point <span class="math">\(p\)</span> where the gradients for <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> are parallel.</p>

<p>Imagine any curve on the sphere that intersects <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. At <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, the gradient for all curves will be normal to the surface. Another way of putting it is that the tangent of that curve at <span class="math">\(p\)</span> will have to lie in the plane whose basis vectors are orthogonal to (in the null space of) ∇f.</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g\]</span></p>

<p>To see this, consider <span class="math">\(f(\textbf{x})\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})=0\)</span> intersects <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. The resulting intersection is a level curve <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})=0\)</span>, and so ∇g will be normal along its path. For a point <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> to be the maximum value of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> on this path, then any move along <span class="math">\(f\)</span> away from <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> must decrease the value of f. Since this is true no matter what curve we picked to go through this path, then all tangents at that point lie in a plane and equivalently, ∇f at <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> is normal to the curve.</p>

<p>As ∇g and ∇f are normal to the curve at <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span>, their respective tangent planes represent the same space. If <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> exists, <span class="math">\(∇g=\lambda∇f\)</span>.</p>

<p>An alternative way of thinking about it follows from calculus. Consider the path through <span class="math">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})=0\)</span>. If we parameterize <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})\)</span> with <span class="math">\(x=h(t), y=j(t), z=k(t)\)</span> then this path is <span class="math">\(f(h(t), j(t), k(t))\)</span>. The derivative with respect to t is then</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{dh}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{dj}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \frac{dk}{dt} = \nabla f \cdot v\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the velocity vector.</p>

<p>The maximum along this path occurs when the derivative <span class="math">\(\frac{df}{dt}=0\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(\nabla f \cdot v = 0\)</span>, that is, when the gradient is orthogonal to the tangent of <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})=0\)</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> in the relationship <span class="math">\(\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g\)</span> is called the <em>Lagrange Multiplier</em>. We know that the gradients, if a extrema point exists where <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> intersect, must occur when <span class="math">\(\nabla f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nabla g\)</span> are parallel. But their exact proportions are unknown. Indeed, their gradients may even be pointing in opposite (but parallel) directions.</p>

<p>This provides us with a equation for each dimension of x. We need one more equation to account for the additional unknown, λ. In this case we&#8217;ll can use the constraint as our last equation, giving us a balanced system which we can solve using the usual methods.</p>

<h2 id="anexample">An Example</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s an image that illustrates the relationship in two dimensions. Consider the circle centered at <span class="math">\((1,1)\)</span> bounded by the line <span class="math">\(x + y = 4\)</span>. How big can we make the radius of the circle and have it all on one side of the line? (Equivalently, given a circle that just touches a line, at what point do they intersect?)</p>

<figure>
<img src="Lagrange0.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>To setup the problem, given</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
  f(\textbf{x}) &= (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 \\
  g(\textbf{x}) &= x + y - 4
  \end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>&#8230;we&#8217;re looking to maximize <span class="math">\(f(\textbf{x})\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})=0\)</span>. We&#8217;ll do so by finding the spot where f and g have parallel tangents proportional to some <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, the Langrange Multiplier. More concisely we express this as <span class="math">\(\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g\)</span>.</p>

<p>After applying the gradient via <span class="math">\(\nabla f = \lambda\nabla g\)</span>, we have</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
 2 x - 2 &= \lambda \\
 2 y - 2 &= \lambda
 \end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>&#8230;leaving two equations and three unknowns. We can use g to provide the necessary third equation:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[x + y = 4\]</span></p>

<p>This system can easily be solved via substitution, giving us <span class="math">\(\lambda = 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x=y=2\)</span>. This gives a maximum radius of <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> (Why not <span class="math">\(2\)</span>? Because we characterized f as <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2\)</span>, so we were actually solving for <span class="math">\(radius^2\)</span>).</p>

<p>This presentation of the Lagrange multiplier is actually an application of what&#8217;s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">Lagrangian function</a>. We can use the Lagrangian to reexpress the problem using one equation:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\mathscr{L}(\textbf{x}, \lambda) = f(\textbf{x}) - \lambda g(\textbf{x})\]</span></p>

<p>To which we apply the gradient, giving</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\nabla\mathscr{L}(\textbf{x}, \lambda) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} - \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} & -g \end{bmatrix} = 0\]</span></p>

<p>&#8230; giving us the requisite number of equations to unknowns.</p>

<h2 id="secondexample">Second example</h2>

<p>Problem setup isn&#8217;t mechanical, it requires some thought. Consider the question of the intersection of the sphere <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2+z^2=2\)</span> and plane <span class="math">\(z = x+y\)</span> in 3d.</p>

<figure>
<img src="SpherePlane.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>A little substitution gives us a set of points along the ellipse of intersection.</p>

<p><span class="math">\(x^2+y^2+(x-y)^2=2 \implies x^2+y^2+x^2-2xy+y^2=2 \implies x^2-xy+y^2=1\)</span></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s attempt to solve using the Lagrange Multiplier method with <span class="math">\(f=x^2+y^2+z^2-2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g=x+y-z\)</span>. Differentiating gives us</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
\nabla f &= \begin{bmatrix} 2x & 2y & 2z \end{bmatrix} \\
\nabla g &= \lambda \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>with a system of three equations with four unknowns.</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
2x &= \lambda \\
2y &= \lambda \\
2z &= \lambda
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>See what happens if we use the constraint function as the last equation?</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
x+y-z &= 0 \\
\frac{\lambda}{2} + \frac{\lambda}{2} - \frac{\lambda}{2} &= 0
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>&#8230;giving us <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> of 0! The problem here was the selection of the last equation: the first three equations tell us that if a maximum <span class="math">\(p=\begin{bmatrix} x &y &z\end{bmatrix}\)</span> exists, <span class="math">\(x=y=z=\frac{\lambda}{2}\)</span> that point. The last equation enforces that that point also lies in the plane. As a result, we solve for a value of x,y,z that lies in the plane with all points equal - that is, 0.</p>

<p>Substituting instead the sphere equation give us:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
x^2+y^2+z^2 &= 2 \\
(\frac{\lambda}{2})^2 + (\frac{\lambda}{2})^2 + (\frac{-\lambda}{2})^2 &= 2 \\
\frac{3 \lambda^2}{4} &= 2 \\
\lambda^2 &= \frac{8}{3} \\
\lambda &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}}
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>Giving values of <span class="math">\(\pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\)</span> for x, y, and z, a solution to the original problem.</p>

<h2 id="multipleconstraints">Multiple constraints</h2>

<p>It should be clear how to extend the method to multiple dimensions, but what about multiple constraint functions? Consider <span class="math">\(f(\textbf{x})\)</span> subject to <span class="math">\(g(\textbf{x})\)</span>, <span class="math">\(h(\textbf{x})\)</span>. Unless <span class="math">\(\nabla g\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\nabla h\)</span> are parallel, we can solving this problem with multiple constraints using Lagrangian multipliers. Expressed as a Lagrangian:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\mathscr{L}(\textbf{x}, \lambda, \mu) = f(\textbf{x}) - \lambda g(\textbf{x}) - \mu h(\textbf{x})\]</span></p>

<p>Taking the partial derivative of <span class="math">\(\mathscr{L}\)</span> (and assuming <span class="math">\(\textbf{x} = (x, y)\)</span>) gives us four equations:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
  {\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial x}} &= \frac{\partial f(\textbf{x})}{\partial x} - \lambda \frac{\partial g(\textbf{x})}{\partial x} - \mu \frac{\partial h(\textbf{x})}{\partial x} \\
  {\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial y}} &= \frac{\partial f(\textbf{x})}{\partial y} - \lambda \frac{\partial g(\textbf{x})}{\partial y} - \mu \frac{\partial h(\textbf{x})}{\partial y} \\
  {\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial \lambda}} &= -g(\textbf{x}) \\
  {\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial \mu}} &= -h(\textbf{x})
  \end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>For example, what are the closest points between the circle <span class="math">\(x^2+y^2=1\)</span> centered around <span class="math">\(2, 2\)</span> and the ellipse <span class="math">\(\frac{2}{3}s^2 + \frac{2}{5}st + \frac{2}{3}t^2 + \frac{3}{4}s+\frac{1}{2}t=2\)</span>? (s and t here correspond to the Cartesian x and y, we picked different letters to distinguish them from the point on the circle).</p>

<p>Since we&#8217;re trying to find the closest point, the function we&#8217;re looking to optimize will be the distance function. Since we&#8217;re looking for the minimum we can just flip the sign.</p>

<p><span class="math">\[f(x,y,s,t) = -((x-s)^2 + (y-t)^2)\]</span></p>

<p>Since we are comparing points on the boundaries of our shapes, our constraint functions are simply the level curves of the implicit form (set equal to 0).</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
g(x,y,s,t) &= (x-2)^2+(y-2)^2-1 \\
h(x,y,s,t) &= \frac{2}{3}s^2 + \frac{2}{5}st + \frac{2}{3}t^2 + \frac{3}{4}s+\frac{1}{2}t-2
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>Giving us
<span class="math">\[\begin{align}
\mathscr{L}(\textbf{x}, \lambda, \mu) &= -((x-s)^2 + (y-t)^2) - \lambda ((x-2)^2+(y-2)^2-1) - \mu (\frac{2}{3}s^2 + \frac{2}{5}st + \frac{2}{3}t^2 + \frac{3}{4}s+\frac{1}{2}t-2)  \\
{\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial x}} &= (s-x) - \lambda (x-1) \\
{\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial y}} &= (t-y) - \lambda (y-1) \\
{\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial s}} &= 2(x-s) - \mu \frac{4}{3}s + \frac{2}{5}t + \frac{3}{4} \\
{\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial t}} &= 2(y-t) - \mu \frac{4}{3}s + \frac{2}{5}t + \frac{1}{2} \\
{\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial \lambda}} &= -((x-2)^2+(y-b)^2-1) \\
{\frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial \mu}} &= -(\frac{2}{3}s^2 + \frac{2}{5}st + \frac{2}{3}t^2 + \frac{3}{4}s+\frac{1}{2}t-2)
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<p>Setting the left hand side to 0 gives us a non-linear system of equations. No fun to solve by hand but easy enough to plug into a numeric solver.</p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
x ~&= 1.265081 \\
y ~&= 1.321845 \\
s ~&= 0.725846 \\
t ~&= 0.824260
\end{align}\]</span></p>
