<p>Focus (on the right path)</p>
<p>So I was partaking in some soft-skills training, specifically a talk from Happy Brain Science. There were some familiar things there: don't check email, multi-tasking doesn't work, etc. but some new (to me) ideas as well. One thing I picked up was a term called &quot;Flow&quot;. It is basically like being 'in the zone', but here was a succinct word with a bit of study behind it.</p>
<p>This Flow describes 'optimal experience' - something we all aspire to if we're watching a sports game or playing a video game or pursuing anything of interest: to be challenged and thrilled by a risk but feel like we're going to win. In being creative, you want to feel like you're progressing - not overwhelmed by the challenge, and not just filling in some color-by-numbers plan or others' vision.</p>
<p>Here's some stuff I cribbed from the webz:</p>
<p>Elements of Flow: * Focus: Concentration on a limited field * Clarity: Explicit goals and immediate feedback * Balance: Match between skills and challenge * No Problemo: feeling of (potential) control * No Sweat: Ease and effortlessness * Time Warp: Altered perception of being * Self-Forgetfulness: Merging of action and consciousness * Autotelic Quality: The journey is the destination</p>
<p>Sounds great! And over the years I've practiced each aspect to varying degrees of success. I'm pretty sure the No-Sweat thing is always going to be a lie, but I can get the time warp and self-forgetfulness in spades, Here's the thing - what if I get into Flow, and it's in the wrong direction? What if I do very well at a task and feel great about it and it's just not the right thing at the right place at the right time?</p>
<p>This applies to bugs as well as features. Just today I got a nasty GPU crash. Debug tools/dumps presented four separate far-apart places the bug could be, and a fifth piece of data testified absolutely it couldn't possibly be any one of them. I had four deep rabbit holes. As I do, I might get into flow down one, verifying that entire subsystems are indeed working as intended, lost in the snow-blind mechanics of code markup and #if 0'ing, recompile and reload screens. And then the day is gone. By the time I wake up, I've not got anything to show for it. Autotelically speaking, when the destination is a worthless dead-end what then is the journey?</p>
<p>So this time, with that double-edged sword Flow on my mind and realizing it was late enough in the day that I didn't want to succumb to its siren's song, I went home where I watched me some Sherlock Holmes - another guy challenged with flow, but at least he gets to the heart of the problem quickly, mostly. While watching I was reminded of how he approaches some problems - &quot;when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>The next morning I then characterized all avenues of potential debugging as impossible. What remained was some rando stomp on everything. I then recalled some recent memory changes that went in and futz'ed with it. Sure enough that was it. Had I dived into any of the suspects from logs and traces, I'd have verified a well-oiled machine, and lost lots of time doing it.</p>
<p>Now, how can I do this type of thing every time? How can I see through the mis-reports, the red herrings quicker? Any path may be to an Isle of Lotus-Eaters, and there is much odyssey to be had! This is my enterprise. No sweat, right?</p>
