<p>When you're isolating bit fields and need both the &quot;before and after&quot;, that is, both the isolated bits and the remaining data with a hole full of zeroes where the bits were, a common approach is this:</p>
<pre><code>uint32_t value = ...;
uint32_t a = value &amp; kFieldMask;     // Isolate &#39;A&#39; bits
uint32_t b = value &amp; ~kFieldMask;    // Isolate the other bits</code></pre>
<p>There is an alternate way to express the same thing that can sometimes come in handy:</p>
<pre><code>uint32_t value = ...;
uint32_t a = value &amp; kFieldMask;     // Isolate &#39;A&#39; bits
uint32_t b = value ^ a;              // Isolate the other bits</code></pre>
<p>This exploits the fact that the xor of <code>value</code> with <code>a</code> will just flip any 1-bits we already isolated in the first logical and.</p>
<p>Mostly this is useful as an optimization for code size, because you avoid storing both <code>kFieldMask</code> and <code>~kFieldMask</code> in the instruction stream. However, the two-mask version probably executes faster on modern CPUs because there is more inherent instruction-level parallelism in that version.</p>
