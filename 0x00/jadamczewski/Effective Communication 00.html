<h1 id="effective-communication">Effective Communication</h1>
<p>Knowing how to engage others, how to listen, thinking through what to say and how to say it, knowing what to leave out, effective follow up, sensitivity and awareness. There is a lot that goes into being a consistently effective communicator.</p>
<p>I consider my ability to communicate to be an essential part of being a game developer - to be able to understand the needs of the people I work with, to know and value their goals, to help manage their expectations (based on my own limitations). By striving to understand and to be understood we build up a shared momentum and a common purpose, untempered by misunderstanding or pointless argument, and are better equipped to make outstanding games.</p>
<p>If you want to be an exceptional game developer, strive to be an exceptional communicator.</p>
<p>My recent experience is that the strongest foundation for effective communication comes from really knowing the people that you communicate with.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do they value?</li>
<li>What are their priorities?</li>
<li>What demands are being made of them?</li>
<li>What are their frustrations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the answers to these questions takes time. Sometimes a lot of it. It can take many forms: sometimes it is organic and straightforward through working together. Mostly, it requires an intentional investment, built on a conviction that knowing the people you work with is a worthwhile pursuit. It can be a slow process, but I find it even a small amount of familiarity goes a long way.</p>
<p>The first challenge I have for myself as I strive to be a more effective communicator is to choose to spend more time with the people I work with â€“ getting to know them, and in doing so being better equipped to work effectively with them.</p>
