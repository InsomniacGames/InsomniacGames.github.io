<p>Temporal anti-aliasing attempts to address artifacts related to screen resolution and high-frequency material shading by accumulating and then presenting the weighted colors of many frames.</p>
<p>To reduce memory cost, we only keep track of a single history buffer and progressively add weighted content to it.</p>
<p>We keep track of pixels previous location by using a velocity buffer. The accuracy of the velocity buffer is paramount to minimizing errors thus we use a two channels FP16 target.</p>
<p>Some other studios make use of a lower precision target in conjunction with some clever encoding scheme.</p>
<p>The weights of the current frame colors depend on many factors: For instance pixels that generate neither depth nor velocity, such as the case of particle effects, tend to be strongly biased towards most recent frames.</p>
<p>Our current approach to differentiate blended scene objects from the opaque elements is to use the stencil buffer. Later in the post-processing stage we load the stencil bits and factor them in the final pixel color weights.</p>
<p>The stencil approach is a bit heavy handed because it doesnâ€™t take the different levels of transparency into account. A better approach might be to accurately track alpha during the blended pass.</p>
