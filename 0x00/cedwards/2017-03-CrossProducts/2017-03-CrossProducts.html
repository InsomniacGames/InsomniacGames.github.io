<h1 id="crossproducts">Cross Products</h1>
<p>The cross product is an operation between two vectors that produces a third vector called a normal. The normal vector is orthogonal to the original two vectors. Given two vectors, $v$ and $w$ and $\theta$ as the angle between those vectors, the cross product $u$ can be visualized as:</p>
<p><img src="CrossProduct.png" alt="Cross Product" /></p>
<p>Unlike the dot product, the cross product is not commutative. If you change the order of the operands so that you have $w \times v$, then you have to negate the vector that is produced (it is a vector that is going in the opposite direction of $u$).</p>
<p>$$v \times w = -(w \times v)$$</p>
<p>The formula to calculate a cross product for three dimensional vectors $v$ and $w$ is:</p>
<p>$$v \times w = (v_y w_z - w_y v_z, v_z w_x - w_z v_x, v_x w_y - w_x v_y) $$</p>
<p>The length of the cross product describes the area formed by the parallelogram of which $v$ and $w$ are two of the sides.</p>
<p>$$||v \times w|| = ||v||||w||\sin\theta$$</p>

<p>One common use case for the cross product as mentioned in its definition is to find the normal to a surface. But just like the dot product, you can use the cross product to determine if $v$ and $w$ are parallel. As the angle between the vectors approaches zero, then the cross product will approach the zero vector. You can create a test resolving to a scalar by also using the dot product. If the vectors $v$ and $w$ are nearly parallel:</p>
<p>$$(v \times w)\cdot(w \times v) \approx 0$$</p>
