The ideas I find most difficult to find “buy in” for, are those that address
scalability and flexibility of our productivity tools. Based on experience of
decades in the game industry, my rule of thumb is that every next triple-A title
has about 10x the number of assets and world complexity. Like Moore’s Law, this
trend seems unlikely to continue, even impossible. But like Moore’s Law, the
trend has yet to be broken.

The tools technology that we are working on today is meant to last us for at
least another two or three triple-A titles after this one. So it seems obvious
to me that our technology needs to be designed to eventually allow us to create
10x, 100x or even 1000x asset load and complexity, three to five years down the
line. To me, it seems obvious that this is not a matter of optimizing code and
buying larger hard drives, but a matter of planning and preparing for a new way
of creating content and collaborating.

Why do I find it so hard to sell this? Why is it that no one else seems
concerned with this problem?

It turns out that it’s not just me. Seth Godin wrote a recent (short) blog post
titled “It’s almost impossible to sell the future” that describes exactly the
kind of problem I’m running into.

Seth ends his piece with this advice:

This suggests that dazzling the audience with the long term benefits is unlikely
to be effective. I will need to find and sell the short term improvements,
slipping in the long range plan under the radar. Doing this in a way that is not
patronizing is going to be hard.
