<p>Although that&#8217;s all I wanted to cover for least squares, there&#8217;s a ton more to cover and most of it of practical use. Least Squares is one of the more basic optimization techniques but also one of the most robust and fastest. I&#8217;d really recommend going through the referenced materials to get an idea both about further applications but also things like the calculus based derivations of the normal equations which I alluded to but didn&#8217;t present.</p>
