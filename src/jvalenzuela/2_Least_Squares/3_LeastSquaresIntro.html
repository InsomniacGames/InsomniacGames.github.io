<h1 id="leastsquarescontinued">Least Squares (continued)</h1>

<p>This is the second part of a two-part writeup about that venerable optimization technique, least squares. I sought mostly to cover stability issues and some interesting variants like Least Squares Polynomial generation and equality constrained Least Squares. I&#8217;d suggest reading through the included references for more detail, especially for the continuous least squares polynomial technique where a detailed derivation is kind of lengthy. Also presented is a solution for ellipse fitting using the quadratic form which I think is simpler than the parametric equation approach.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d appreciate any corrections or other feedback.</p>
