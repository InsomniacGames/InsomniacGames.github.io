<h1 id="dotproducts">Dot Products</h1>

<p>The dot product is also known as the Euclidean inner product.  It is an operation between two 
vectors that returns a scalar result.  It can be represented in a couple of ways.  Given two
vectors, $v$ and $w$, and the angle between them as $\theta$, the dot product is:
$$v \cdot w=||v||||w||\cos\theta$$</p>

<p>$||v||$ is the norm of $v$ and is a measure of distance.  For a 3D vector, it is calculated as:
$$||v|| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$</p>

<p>You can also calculate the dot product without $\theta$ with this equation:
$$v \cdot w=v_x w_x + v_y w_y + v_z w_z$$</p>

<p>The Law of Cosines is what enables this equivalency.  When talking about two vectors, imagine 
placing them end to end with $\theta$ as the angle between the vectors.  If you were to form a 
triangle, the side opposite of $\theta$ would be the vector $v - w$.</p>

<p><img src="LawOfCosines.png" alt="Law Of Cosines" /></p>

<p>The Law of Cosines gives us this equation:
$$||v-w||^2 = ||v||^2 + ||w||^2 - 2||v|| ||w|| \cos\theta$$</p>

<p>After plugging in the equations for the length of each side ($\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$) and
reducing terms, you will arrive at:
$$||v|| ||w||\cos\theta = v_x w_x + v_y w_y + v_z w_z$$</p>

<p>So, $v \cdot w=||v||||w||\cos\theta=v_x w_x + v_y w_y + v_z w_z$.</p>

<p>What is the dot product useful for?  It can tell you about the angle between two vectors which
is useful in line of sight tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>If $v$ and $w$ are perpendicular, the dot product will be 0.</li>

<li>If $v \cdot w &lt; 0$, $\theta$ is greater than $90^{\circ}$ and a target is behind the observer</li>

<li>If $v \cdot w > 0$, $\theta$ is less than $90^{\circ}$ and a target is in front of the observer</li>
</ul>
